## FEATURES
One of the features we will implement is the Review section. The
Review is going to be a section of the application that will allow
the user to select how many days they are planning on studying for.
We will then divide that number by the total amount of notes that
are present, and create an even split of a certain amount of notes
for a specific number of days. Each note will have an indicator for
which day it is supposed to be completed by. There will also be a
button on each note that will allow the user to keep track of the
progress they have made so far. 

Another one of the features we will implement the Suggestions
section. The Suggestions section will take the information that
is provided when creating a note, and it will attempt to suggest
youtube video links that are relevant to the specific note. 

Furthermore, we will also implement a Ranking feature. This
feature will be used to indicate how comfortable a user is with the
information on a specific note card. The user will be able to change
how they feel about a notecard by clicking on one of three buttons
that will be used to measure the topic’s difficulty. For simplicity, the
buttons will be called easy, medium, and hard. 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Whether it is in a grocery store, school setting, or at work, the
method of note-taking is a vital technique that many people use
to retain their knowledge. On a daily basis, people return to their
previously written notes to refresh their memory on a particular
topic or guide them through their day, and it is during this process that the importance of note-taking is made clear. The inherent
benefits provided by this form of reinforced learning are countless,
especially as it continues to shape the way we process information and our day-to-day functions. People can always expect their
notes to assist them with their attention span and ability to retain
information, however, this does not always result in a productive
plan or reaching their desired end goal. We plan to solve the issue
that arises when someone has a lot of information, but no real way
to keep track of what progress has been made. There are so many
instances where people will keep more notes than they need to in
order to study. This happens a lot in college as some professors
won’t directly tell their students what to take notes on, and as a
result, many people will take notes on everything as a precautionary measure. Eliminating these redundancies would undoubtedly
provide a more effective approach to studying, providing the user
with the opportunity to solely focus on the topics and themes that
were relevant. The target audience for our application will consist
of all people who plan to study for some specific upcoming event.
More specifically, we plan to focus on students who are preparing
for an upcoming exam or quiz.

Having a well-ordered plan is one of the key measures of success
for completing a variety of objectives. The lack of this in many
other note-taking applications is striking, which is why we have
decided to provide an enhanced note-taking application. A variety
of note-taking applications allow for the creation and organization
of folders and tabs, but don’t provide any support in regards to
forming and organizing a plan of execution to study effectively.
As great as tabs and folders are in note applications, they don’t
play a huge role in helping the users strategize a way for them to
learn large volumes of information quickly and efficiently. Giving
users the ability to create a plan that suits their needs given their
time availability would be best. For example, if someone previously
recorded their notes for math class and had the ability to tell the
application that they desired to re-learn the material in 48 hours,
and the device could create a scheduled two day plan for it, it would
be much more effective. This in essence is great for a multitude of
reasons. For example, it will help reduce the probability of the student waiting until the last minute to study and not having sufficient
time to retain information. Secondly, it provides the opportunity to
evenly distribute the amount of time someone planned on studying
for each class, offering better time management. This is especially
important since different classes require a different amount of time
for out-of-class activities.
