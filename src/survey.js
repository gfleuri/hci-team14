          hypothetical situation, you have 3 days to study for your biology
          exam, and you need to take notes on a biology chapter, save it in your
          biology folder, and create a study plan where your notes are ordered
          by descending level of difficulty over the next 3 days.

            Home office: The nucleus
            <br />
            <br />
            The nucleus houses and protects the cellâ€™s DNA, which contains all
            of the instructions necessary for the cell to function. The DNA is
            like a set of blueprints for the cell, so you can think of the
            nucleus as the office where the blueprints are kept. If information
            from the blueprints is required, the information is copied into RNA
            molecules and moved out of the nucleus. The DNA plans stay safely
            locked away.
